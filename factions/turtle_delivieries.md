short: Manage orders and get pizza to everyone on the forest. As cards move along the order track your reward for a timely delivery decreases.

The turtles are not bothered by the war around them, and only want to deliver pizza.  In birdsong, orders are placed on an order track.
The earlier on the track the pizza's are delivered, the higher the point rewards will be.
