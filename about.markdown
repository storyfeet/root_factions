Welcome to Root Factions. The purpose of this site is to chronicle the various fan made factions for the popular asynchronous board game [Root](https://ledergames.com/products/root-a-game-of-woodland-might-and-right).

It is hosted on github, and the easiest way to make changes is to do so through pull requests. more information [here](https://github.com/storyfeet/root_factions)

I am working on the assumption that fans who have put their factions on BGG want people to find them and play them, as I do mine

Faction reviews and feedback will be accepted as long as feedback is constructive.
