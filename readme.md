Root Factions
==============

A curated list of fan factions for the game ROOT (By Leder Games)

The purpose of this site is to make it easy for people to publish their faction boards in a way that allow people to easily search and download the boards they want.

To add a board to the list, please either make a pull request through the normal means, or if not sure how to do that, then raise an issue, and we can try to work this out.

Each faction should have their own page in the "factions" section, and all images relating to them should be in their own folder in the "faction\_data" folder.
